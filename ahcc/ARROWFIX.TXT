Why this all is necessary is not found in any documentation, but it works.
If mp[2] never changes to >0 there is no problem and it works normal.

It seems that if you hold the button down on an arrow, mp[2] becomes >0,
but that in some TOSes the wait time is so short that you get 2 events
on what seems to be only 1 click; one event with 0 and one with x20 in mp[2].
