A Home Cooked C compiler:   AHCC   aka  ANSI Sozobon (HCC).
   
    AHCC is a Pure C compatible  compiler/assembler for the ATARI ST and its offspring.

Changes:
	november 27 2020
	v6.0
	Compiler:
		built_in offsetof improved.

		Attempts to generalize expressions involving a constant
		casted to a pointer to a type.
		This enables translating the Pure C style offsetof macro.
		For the time being only the latter ;-).

		New flags word xflgs in NODECOMMON (needed more flags :-/)
		New flag pasc (for 'pascal' modifier)
		Pascal modifier implemented as described in the Pure C manual.

		Improvements of the handling of nested projects.
		When in a nested prpject option .L[-J] is absent, the result
		will be a executable of which the first input file should be
		the start up code.

		Fixed a regression since march 2009 concerning absolute
		indexes other than zero.

		Fixed a terrible bug in send_msg() where a indent counter
		could be less than zero, where it was checked against non zero.
			Oeps! :-)

		changed
		GEMDOS to __GEMDOS__
		XBIOS  to __XBIOS__
		BIOS   to __BIOS__

		in trap.h, tos.h
		making them compiler specific.

		vqt_fontheader in vdi.h:
		changed void *buf to char *buf

		Now SE_FAKT should compile.

		Start up code is not anymore a special case.
		It is simply the first input file of the project
		and should call 'main' in the unixoid way (that is main(argc, argv) ).
		Removed code handling that special case.
		AHCC looks for all projects .o input files in the same places
		as for libraries.

		BTW: AHCC allows you to choose a different name than 'main'
		with the same purpose. See the KIT's 'name of root function' field.

		The error message 'end of file in comment' now displays
		the number of the line of the opening comment token.

	Shell:
		Accept .ovl as a valid output filename extension.
		Better handling in locating include files
		in nested projects.
		Always compile for MC6888x (Line F) because
		AHCC does not implement s/w floating point.
		Nested project are now compiled (when needed) in the order
		represented by the project file in relation to the other
		input files.

	CALC:
		Moved the edit object to the top of the window, no more
		paint errors when size'ing or full'ing

	CALC & function common/F_x.C
		Unary operator cV. Meaning Cubic root.
		PE:
		cV 27      yields 3
		cV 125     yields 5
		cV 1953125 yields 125

	General:
		All windows:
			Open a virtual VDI workstation per window and use that.

		This distribution does not hold anymore any Pure C produced
		binaries. All binaries (including libraries) are produced by
		the appropriate AHCC incarnation.

	Not for the public, but mainly for myself. HR.
		Editor:
			'Compare 2' treats consecutive empty lines
			as 1 line.

			So:
			any consecutive number of empty lines in 1 file
			is the same as
			any consecutive number of empty lines in the other file
			in the same relative position within both files.
			:-)

		All windows: abolished right and down margins.
			These are not very neat or useful with sizeable windows.

		Compiler:
			Abolish pragmat noregs
			Replace pragmat new_peep by nopeep for suppressing
			  both registerization and all optimizations.
			Tested by a seperate incarnation of AHCC.
			Correct line number in error 'no dclarator for ...'.
			Fixed a memory leak with '-I's.
			Small fixes in code generation in rare situations.
