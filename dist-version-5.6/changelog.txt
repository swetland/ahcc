Changes:
December 1 2017
v5.6

Editor:
	Lines longer than max characters not having any space
	were incorrectly split. Fixed.
	Now splitting is done at any (viable)punctuation,
	loosing that character.
	Also a alert is displayed.
	KIT: field 'split lines' should have been TOUCHEXIT. Fixed.
	Pure C (standard) ispunct is a nonsense function.
	New function is_punct in common/aaaa_lib.c
	moved functions is_alpha and is_alnum to aaaa_lib as well.
	This kind of split is not considered a change, however:
	when the file is saved, the new state of the lines is saved
	as well.
	Beware!! including the character loss when not corrected.
Compiler:
	Flag missing initializers. (also missing in HCC :-)
	Fixed message [2]arg nil.
	  (happened with propagated assignments involving bit fields.
	   e.g. a.x=b.y=z where x or y are bit fields.)
	Generic list routines in its own file and header
	(list.c, list.h)
	Fixed 'warn .. r1 in use' for ^ operator (exclusive or).
	A little bit of cleanup.
Linker:
	No of files reported 1 too many. Fixed.
	Matching 8 byte names against longer names
	  now works both ways.
Standard library:
	Fixed wrong declarations of 'struct time' and 'struct date'.
	math.h : moved prototype of 'atof' to a place where it now
	is declared for AHCC as well.
Shell:
	Improved 'Make All' statistics.
	Replaced VDI input functions for the mouse (needing physical
	  workstation handle) by approppriate AES functions.
	  (notably: vq_mouse, v_hide_c and v_show_c)
	Thanks to Olivier landemarre for pointing this out.
	Small improvement in load/saveconfig (aaaa_lib.c).
Applications: CALC:
	Small improvement in parser: skip spaces between : and %.
	Specifying a new filename forces a create.
	(Non functional menu 'new' removed.)
	Pure C's scanf has problems with text fields > 31: fixed.
	exactly 32 not fixed, but avoided (too much uncertainties).
Shell: ESC in journal, menu Calc (calculator)
Applications: CALC & TINYCALC:
	Generalization of the parse routines.
	Both programs now use the same routines from /common/
	i.e. F_x.c, F_x.h

	F_x(x, y, text) now can be used as a function of x in programs
	that display values of x for many x's.
	i.e. X^2+2*x+1   or (x+1)^2 or x^2+2*x*y+y^2 or (x+y)^2
	:-)

	CALC must only be compiled by AHCC.
	Pure C's f get/set pos are a little bit unreliable.
	TINYCALC is now part of CALC in the AHCC source distribution.

Whole::=
	replaced any use of .. scanf by appropriate simpler
	alternatives. Saves about 2.5K
